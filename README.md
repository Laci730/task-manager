# Task manager 

This is an application for managing tasks or to set some goals.

I'm using react with typescript for developing.

The website has a login feature, so you have to sign up to be able to use it. Since this project made for show my frontend skills, there is no backend, so your credentials are stored in the browser's local storage.

After logging in you will be able to create a task by giving it a name, an expiration date and a description (optional). Click on "Add task" button. The new task will appear on your task list. You can edit the description even if it doesn't exist, allowing you to create it later.
